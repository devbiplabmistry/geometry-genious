        <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Question-1 : What is DOM and what is purpose of DOM ?</p>
        <p>The full form of DOM is document object model, we show complete html through javascript
            in way of object. its main purpose is to
            defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

            The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites. JavaScript
            can also be used in other contexts.
            <br>
            The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural
            representation of the document available from a single, consistent API
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Question-2 : How you select element from DOM ?</p>
        <p>We select five using selectors to select element from Dom.
            <h4 class="mt-2"> a. getElementsByTagName()</h4>
            <h4 class="mt-2 mb-2"> b. getElementsByClassName()</h4>
            <h4>c.getElementById()</h4>
            <h4 class="mt-2 mb-2"> d.querySelector()</h4>
            <h4 class="mb-2"> e. querySelectorAll()</h4>
            <p>Note: if we use querySelectorAll then we get all elements , but if we use only querySelector then we get
                only first element.</p>
        </p>



        <p class="mb-4 mt-4 font-bold">Question-3 : What is Event bubble ?</p>
        <p>Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API inside another element, and both elements
            have registered a handle to one event.
            <br>
            <br>
            it first starts with the element that we triggered by the event and then check to the containing element to
            the upper level i.e the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to
            outer elements.
            <br>
            <br>
            we also can handle this bubble propagation easily by using event.stopPropagation();
            if we stop immediate propagation then we use event.stopImmediatePropagation.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4 mt-4 font-bold">Question-4 : What is call back function ,purpose of callback function ?</p>
        <p>
            call back function is function which is used as an argument into another function,we use it for doing some
            kinds of action inside the outer function.
            A callback's purpose is to execute code in response to an event.the response can be any types.
            <br>
            <br>
            we mainly use call back function to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed.
